--------------

In Raw_Assets:

SpotlightObject.uasset - Is a combination of a spotlight object and a cone object. The cone is not visible, and used for detecting overlap. Upon overlap, the level will restart. May need resizing.

In ThirdPersonBP:

ThirdPersonCharacter.uasset - This is not the completed character asset, and still has more features to be added! Currently, upon pressing E, movement speed and crouch movement speed is increased for 8 seconds, and on cooldown for 20 seconds. There is nothing in the UI to indicate this yet, but there will need to be.
